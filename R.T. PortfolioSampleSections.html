            <h1> Rylan Turner's Portfolio </h1>
            <p> 
                This site contains information that provides insight into who I am and what I have 
                accomplished. Most of this site will currently consist of my relevant computer science 
                coursework and projects over the years that I was pursuing my Bachelor's degree. 
                On this site there will be links to github repositories as well as video demonstrations 
                of some projects that are better demonstrated visually. These listings will also have 
                descriptions of what they contain where I try my best to explain what I have done regarding 
                the work.

<!-- IDEAS FOR PORTFOLIO SECTIONS 
- Top of page has a picture of me as well as a title/description of what this portfolio site has on it
- Github repo links/description of what those include for code I have created
- Video demo sections for specifically my senior project demo(s)
